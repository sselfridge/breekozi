        Math with Michele Koziara
      </h3>
      <p>
        With nearly twenty years of experience, Michele Koziara is the Math expert. She is
        well-versed in both Traditional Math (Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra-1, Algebra-2) and
        Common Core Math (Math-7, Math-8, Math-1 & Math-1 Enhanced, Math-2 & Math 2-Enhanced,
        Math-3).
      </p>

      <p>
        While many Math teachers know the subject matter, they can’t articulate their thoughts and
        students are left struggling and frustrated. Mrs. K breaks down difficult concepts and helps
        her students develop the foundational knowledge and skills they need to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond her expert instruction and warm personality, Michele also provides her students with
        valuable resources with which to practice the concepts they’ll be tested on, helping to
        eliminate test-day stress and anxiety.
      </p>
