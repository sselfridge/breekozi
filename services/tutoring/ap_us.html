          <b>Structured weekly group program:</b> Bree offers a structured weekly tutoring program
          to help students better navigate this difficult college-level course. During the school
          year, Bree teaches her APUSH students the course content and more, helping them prepare
          for their multiple choice tests, FRQs, and the May AP Exam (see College Board Course
          Content Description, below). One-hour prepared group lesson per week; instruction takes
          place at the same day/time.
        </li>
        <li class="padding-vert">
          <b>New group formation:</b> If an open weekly group does not currently exist, it takes 4
          students minimum to form a group (students must provide partners who attend the same
          school). Space is limited and spots fill on a first-come, first-served basis. There is a
          waitlist system in place.
        </li>
        <li class="padding-vert">
          <b>As-needed private help:</b> While most students prefer the guidance, support, and
          resources associated with Bree’s structured weekly program, Bree is also available on an
          as-needed basis when students need help on a particular topic.
