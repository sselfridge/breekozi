      <h3>
        The Importance of Writing
      </h3>

      <p>
        Strong writing skills are of the utmost importance. Not only does writing equip students
        with the communication and critical thinking skills they will need to excel in middle
        school, high school, college, and beyond, writing is the primary basis upon which their
        learning and intellect will be judged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents, educators, and policymakers agree that writing is important; yet there is a
        difference between setting standards or defining expectations and actually teaching students
        how to write. Although students are required to write in nearly every one of their classes
        and their teachers expect them to know how to write well, students are struggling with
        writing.
      </p>

        <li>
          Three-quarters of both 8th and 12th graders lack proficiency in writing (National
          Assessment of Educational Progress)

        <li>
          80 percent of 8th graders and 79 percent of 12th graders performed at the Basic (lowest)
          level in writing. Only 3 percent of 8th and 12th graders performed at the Advanced
          (highest) level (Department of Education)

        Writing Fundamentals Workshop
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description:</b> Although teachers expect students to know how to write well, writing is
        not taught in school, as it should be. Bree will teach you how to become a better writer
        through a series of skill-building lessons that make writing formulaic. Bree helps to make
        writing formulaic by focusing on five paragraph essay writing fundamentals in her
        introductory Writing Fundamentals Workshop (4-hour workshop):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Five paragraph essay structure and content
        </li>

        <li>
          The steps of the writing process (from understanding the assignment to editing)
        </li>

        <li>
          Intro to MLA format
        </li>

        <li>
          Detailed instructions on how to become a better writer in the long-term
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The writing fundamentals workshop is designed as a crash course in five paragraph essay
        writing with a key focus on structure, content, and process; it is a jumping off point to
        provide students with concrete instruction and tools at an early age, with the hope that
        they'll apply their learnings throughout high school and continue to use the resources and
        advice after the workshop is over.
      </p>
      Format: 4-hour workshop
      <p>
        Availability: Writing Fundamentals Workshops are offered throughout the year and can also be
        booked on demand; either privately or via new group formation. Please email Bree at {%
        include email.html email="KoziAcademy@gmail.com" %} with any writing workshop inquiries.

      <h3>
        The Importance of Study Skills
      </h3>
      <p>
        While students are often told to “study smarter, not harder,” many students struggle with
        study skills; they either don’t know where to start or the results they’re getting do not
        reflect their substantial efforts and they don’t know why. While there’s no silver bullet,
        Bree’s study skills lessons and workshops provide students with a comprehensive approach to
        improving their ability to learn more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, developing and applying a robust set study skills throughout middle and high school
        will help students excel at all stages of life and minimize stress along the way.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Teens report higher stress than ever before with grades, homework, and preparing for
          college listed as the greatest sources of stress for both genders (The American
          Psychological Association)
        </li>
        <li>
          Beyond that, many students enter college underprepared and forced to take remedial classes
          (which generally have the same tuition costs and structure as other college courses, but
          do not confer credit toward a degree).
        </li>
        <li>
          More than 50 percent of students entering two-year colleges and nearly 20 percent of those
          entering four-year universities are placed in remedial classes. (Complete College America
          study)
        </li>
        <li>
          While remedial education is intended to help students attain the skills they need to
          succeed in college, it can deter completion by adding to the cost and the time it takes to
          complete to a degree (PREPARE Act)
        </li>
        <li>
          Once admitted, the overall dropout rate for undergraduate college students is 40 percent,
          with approximately 30 percent of college freshmen dropping out before their sophomore year
          (National Center for Education Statistics)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fewer than 6 in 10 college students graduate in six years (National Student Clearinghouse
          Report)
        </li>
