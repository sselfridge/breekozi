      <p>
        Strong writing skills are of the utmost importance. Not only does writing equip students
        with the communication and critical thinking skills they will need to excel in middle
        school, high school, college, and beyond, writing is the primary basis upon which their
        learning and intellect will be judged.

        Although teachers expect students to know how to write well, writing is not taught in
        school, as it should be. Bree will teach you how to become a better writer through a series
        of skill-building lessons that make writing formulaic. Bree helps to make writing formulaic
        by focusing on five paragraph essay writing fundamentals in her introductory Writing
        Fundamentals Workshop.

        While students are often told to “study smarter, not harder,” many students struggle with
        study skills; they either don’t know where to start or the results they’re getting do not
        reflect their substantial efforts and they don’t know why. While there’s no silver bullet,
        Bree’s study skills lessons and workshops provide students with a comprehensive approach to
        improving their ability to learn more effectively.

        Bree helps students develop their study skills and learn how to “study smarter, not harder”
        in her Study Skills Workshop.
