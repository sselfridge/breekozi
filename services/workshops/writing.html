        Writing
      </h3>
      <p>
        Although teachers expect students to know how to write well, writing is not taught in
        school, as it should be. Bree will teach you how to become a better writer through a series
        of skill-building lessons. Bree helps to make writing formulaic by focusing on five
        paragraph essay writing fundamentals in her introductory Writing Fundamentals Workshop.

        The Importance of Writing
      </h3>

      <p>
        Strong writing skills are of the utmost importance. Not only does writing equip students
        with the communication and critical thinking skills they will need to excel in middle
        school, high school, college, and beyond, writing is the primary basis upon which their
        learning and intellect will be judged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents, educators, and policymakers agree that writing is important; yet there is a
        difference between setting standards or defining expectations and actually teaching students
        how to write. Although students are required to write in nearly every one of their classes
        and their teachers expect them to know how to write well, students are struggling with
        writing.

          80 percent of 8th graders and 79 percent of 12th graders performed at the Basic (lowest)
          level in writing. Only 3 percent of 8th and 12th graders performed at the Advanced
          (highest) level (Department of Education)
