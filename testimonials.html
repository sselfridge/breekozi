      Hi Bree, I wanted to let you know how much Shea enjoyed your session today. She said it was
      incredibly helpful and that you were so nice to work with. Tonight she said “I’m so grateful
      we found her”! Thank you for helping to organize the massive quantity of information and
      making it much more manageable to study! Thank you, Jill T.

      Thank you, Bree! Your program has been invaluable to Alison this year. You helped her adjust
      to the rigor of her first AP class and helped her learn how to succeed. She has been studying
      harder than I've ever seen and from my point of view she's truly doing her best. Thank you so
      much.
