      "Bree has our family’s highest endorsement for her stellar tutoring services. Over a six-year period, both my students utilized her for tutoring in various middle and high school subjects (including US History, English book reviews and AP World History). Not only does Bree provide excellent curriculum review, but she takes it a step further by following-up with very comprehensive, user-friendly PowerPoint presentations to reinforce her live tutoring sessions. She helps students develop good study skills and holds them to the high standards, in an encouraging and positive way. As a parent, I appreciate how easy Bree is to work with; she is flexible, responsive and prepared. She maintains a workplace that is convenient and easy to access, as it is walking distance from school. She operates with the highest level of integrity and professionalism. When new families come to CdM and ask for advice on how their children can be successful there, I always tell them to sign up with Bree as soon as you possibly can. She is a wonderful resource and I am grateful for her support of our children’s academic endeavors over the years. ",

      "Our two children have utilized seven years of Bree Koziara's academic classes from her Middle School Study Skills boot camp and English literature reviews to AP level courses, including AP World History and APUSH. She has an extremely thorough knowledge of the subject matter that often helps fill instructional gaps. Unlike other tutors, she keeps abreast of teacher schedules and provides in-depth supplemental information not offered in the classroom environment. Her classes helped not only with subject comprehension, but also AP testing performance, giving my son over a semester's worth of college credit. Bree is very approachable and personable and you can tell she has a personal interest in the performance of each child. ",

Your advice on memorizing the periods with their corresponding taglines make it much easier to remember all the events in history, and quickly make decisions on answers based on dates. The broad brush strokes of history were much easier to comprehend and then break down into details rather than trying to find a point out of a thousand. Thanks again for all of your hard work and patience! Wishing you the best",

      "Btw, Miles got an A in AP Hist last year and 4 on AP exam, so did OK. Hoping regular US won’t be too taxing….I almost forgot to add that any success was in no small part a result of your sessions…. I passed on the results for your students’ stats, which I am sure speak for themselves. ",

      "Bree has been a wonderful added teacher/tutor for my kids. I have two children who both used her during their AP classes at CDMH. Sophia, my oldest, is now attending UCLA. She had Bree for AP World tutoring once a week and always attended her additional workshops (Summer Boot Camp, Writing Workshops, and AP Exam Review Program). She ended up getting a 5 on the AP World exam. Lucas, who is still at CdMHS took her AP World class and will be using her for AP US History. Bree offers very detailed and comprehensive instruction for all of these subjects and has filled in the gaps for the AP Exam.  The quality of instruction and take home materials, combined with all her additional resources for the kids has been wonderful. She is a delight to work with and a MUST to get through AP’s for my kids. I highly recommend her services..",

      "Bree Koziara has tutored all three of my CdM students over the last 7 or 8 years. She has not only helped them achieve success in their Honors and AP classes, but also assisted them in learning the writing skills that are necessary in college.They also participated in the English Book Review workshops when offered and this was a great way for them to brush up on analyzing the novels. I am thankful for all the help that Bree has offered our students and highly recommend her for anyone who is in the AGS Program or is taking the AP World and AP U.S. History classes.",

Her materials help students organize their thoughts and ideas, providing them with useful frameworks that help them get the most from their classes in the social sciences.",

      "Thank you for a fabulous year tutoring Samantha in her small group and then Zoom private’s at home and for being flexible and letting me add her sister. Keeping up the weekly sessions during quarantine was super helpful in holding the girls accountable and also maintaining a sense of normal. Working with you gave Samantha a lot of confidence owning the material. I can see it in her teachers comments and, obviously, it is reflected in the grades she earned. She finished strong with an A... both Fall and Spring semesters!!!.",
